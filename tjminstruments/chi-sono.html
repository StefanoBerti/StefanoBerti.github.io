                  <p class="lead">Hi!
                     I'm Tomas, i'm an Italian musical instrument builder, musician and music educator.
                     I live in the province of Savona, Italy.
                     <br><br>
                     I grew up in Genoa and its hinterland, in Liguria, Italy.
                     My musical life began when i was 13, and started stealing my father's acoustic guitar to play it alone in our dusty attic, making sure nobody could hear me.
                     It was the beginning of a fantastic journey, and i went on to take guitar lessons from a family friend, Ignazio Serventi.
                     <br><br>
                     I bought my first electric guitar and i loved it so much that i wanted to know everything about it:
                     that's the moment when my interest in muscal instrument building came out.
                     I started reading books, straightening guitar necks, swapping pickups and bridges, making custom electronics when i was 15, all while playing drums in a punk band of friends.
                     <br><br>
                     I started playing and learning new instruments, becoming passionate about sounds and musical cultures from all around the world; i build and play percussion instruments, winds, harps and strings of all shape and sizes.
                     From guitar shredding to sabar drumming, from Afrocuban batà drums to Slovakian fujaras and koncovkas, from gamelan ensembles to Madagascar valiha and voatavo playing, saxophone licks and pygmy flutes..
                     I just love how we, as a whole, managed to always find a way to let sound happen.
                     Music for me is a way to listen, to hear stories, making friends and getting to know myself.
                     <br><br>
                     Being able to explore and witness this incredible human phenomenon is a fantastic source pf enthusiasm and gratitude.

               <div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">
                  <h2 class="featurette-heading">How and Why</h2>
                  <p class="lead">
                     I started making steel tongue drums when i was 17:
                     I went around the city to find old gas tanks to transform into my first sound sculptures, while turning my garage into my first "workshop".
                     <br><br>
                     After a lot of good old trial and error, i eventually started selling my drums at flea markets.
                     It was a beautiful and human rich experience, that made me grow a lot.
                     I learned how to to fine tune the metal tongues, how to make good and sturdy bamboo beaters, how to finish every piece and now, after a year of redesign and rethinking, i'm building them with stainless steel, bolts and a contact microphone system.
                     <br><br>
                     Building a complete instrument from start to finish is an incredible rollercoaster of emotions.
                     Focusing, concentration, dedication and passion all come together when you suddenly realise the instrument is ready to be played.
                     <br><br>
                     After an instrument is finished, instead of cleaning, i usually stand playing it in my workshop as time shifts until sunset.
                     This is what i want to share with my craft.
                     <br><br>
                     As a musician, i need to find instruments that are balanced, responsive, and well made.
                     As a maker, i need to find materials and tools that let me work with no compromises.
                     As a human being, i love listening to the expression of pure passion.
